In this assignment I demonstrated building a REACT framework from the command prompt using node.js, programming the application in javascript, and using an API to display information using maps. Originally, I had trouble with getting the leaflet map to load properly on to the the body of the webpage, but I had to reference the map using the predifined script and stylesheet from leaflet so that the tiles would load in properly, I had to make sure that I was using react to update the root div and seperate the root div from the newly implemented and returned map div, and since I mixed those two up from time and time, the page would not display. Another part of the lab I had trouble in was setting up the framework, as I realized that I needed a package.json to run the npm run dev command on a local host.

For mylist, I let the user create as many markers as they would like, and have a reset button at the bottom to wipe the list. Once the useRef list is cleared, then all the markers with their own user-inputted details will go away.
